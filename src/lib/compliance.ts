/**
 * Continuous Health Canada readiness checks: the catalog and the arithmetic. Pure; the queries
 * that find the offending records live in `features/compliance/queries.ts`.
 *
 * The checks encode the record-keeping duties a licence holder must satisfy at all times under the
 * Cannabis Regulations: record retention (s.221-232), inventory and reconciliation (s.244) and
 * the destruction-witness duty (s.230). Each check is an exception list, so the console points at
 * the exact records that would fail an inspection rather than a pass/fail bit.
 *
 * Nothing here is English prose: findings and their offenders carry ids and parameters, and the
 * console translates them (`overview.findings.<id>`, `overview.details.<key>`).
