/**
 * Single source of truth for product identity.
 *
 * Every user-visible mention of the product name goes through here so a future

 * Tomerio) were scattered; keep them out of UI copy.
 *
 * Note on wording: the platform is deliberately domain-neutral. Cannabis
 * research is the first vertical, not the definition of the product, so copy
 * here says "sample" and "material" rather than "plant" or "cannabis".
